# Learning

Work is not a to do list, it is content.

Content is made up of:

- examples
- illustrations
- screenshots
- statistics
- mindmaps
- diagrams
- book notes
- quotes

Notes are:

- Personal, informal, quick and dirty: notes are optimized not for public consumption, but for your own personal use, like a leather notebook you keep in your backpack
- Open-ended and never finished: “taking notes” is a continuous and generative process, in which you can noodle on ideas without an explicit purpose in mind
- Low expectations for quality/polish: notes are low friction, because they can be messy, incomplete, nonsensical or totally random
- Mix diverse types of media: just like a paper notebook might contain drawings and sketches, quotes and ideas, and even a pasted photo or post-it note, notes naturally combine diverse types of media in one place
